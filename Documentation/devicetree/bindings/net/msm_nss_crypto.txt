- reg: Physical address and length of the register set for the device.
- qcom,ee: Number of interrupt lines(Execution Environments) supported by BAM.

Optional properties:
- qcom,secure-mode-enabled: Enables the HW to store keys securely.
  If secure-mode is enabled, non-secure mode is fully disabled.

Example:

crypto0: crypto@e8000000 {
	 compatible = "qcom,nss-crypto";
	 reg-names = "crypto_pbase", "bam_base";
	 reg = <0xe8000000 0x20000>,
	     <0xe8004000 0x22000>;
	 qcom,ee = <0>;
	 qcom,secure-mode-enabled;
};
